	在像人类这样的复杂真核生物中，基因通常更大，含有更多内含子和调控区域，这是由于基因调控的增加复杂性和对更复杂控制机制的需求所致。另一方面，在像大肠杆菌这样的简单原核生物中，基因较小，通常不含内含子，因为它们具有更简化的基因表达过程。

### Question mentioned in TOC-1

This image is a graphical representation of the genome sizes of various organisms, measured in nucleotide pairs per haploid genome. The x-axis represents the genome size on a logarithmic scale, ranging from 10^5 to 10^12 nucleotide pairs. The organisms are grouped into categories, such as mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes, crustaceans, insects, nematode worms, plants, algae, fungi, protozoans, bacteria, and archaea. Each organism is represented by a green horizontal bar, which shows the range of genome sizes within that group or species. The yellow lines within the bars indicate specific genome sizes for certain species.

#### Key Observations:

- **Mammals, Birds, Reptiles**: The human genome is highlighted with a yellow line, and the genome size range for this group is between 10^9 and 10^10 nucleotide pairs.
- **Amphibians, Fishes**: Species like *Fugu*, zebrafish, frogs, and newts are shown, with newts having a particularly large genome size (close to 10^11 nucleotide pairs).
- **Crustaceans, Insects**: The genome sizes of shrimp and *Drosophila* (fruit fly) are shown, with shrimp having a larger genome.
- **Nematode Worms**: *Caenorhabditis* is represented with a genome size around 10^8 nucleotide pairs.
- **Plants, Algae**: *Arabidopsis*, wheat, and lily are highlighted, with lily having one of the largest genomes among plants, close to 10^11 nucleotide pairs.
- **Fungi**: Yeast is shown with a smaller genome size compared to other organisms, around 10^7 nucleotide pairs.
- **Protozoans**: The amoeba has the largest genome size in the chart, approaching 10^12 nucleotide pairs.
- **Bacteria**: *Mycoplasma* and *E. coli* are represented with relatively small genome sizes, around 10^6 to 10^7 nucleotide pairs.
- **Archaea**: This group has a genome size ranging around 10^6 nucleotide pairs.

#### Conclusion:

The chart illustrates the vast range of genome sizes across different domains of life, with some organisms like amoebas having remarkably large genomes, while others like bacteria have much smaller ones.

### Question mentioned in TOC-2

The conclusion that "gene density increases while gene size decreases in complex eukaryotic genomes" can be deduced from the diagram, mainly through the following analyses:

1. **Relationship between Gene Number and Genome Length**:
	- **Escherichia coli** has 57 genes with a relatively small genome length, showing high gene density.
	- **Saccharomyces cerevisiae** has 31 genes with a moderate genome length, exhibiting high gene density.
	- **Drosophila melanogaster** has 9 genes with an increased genome length, resulting in decreased gene density.
	- **Human** has only 2 genes, but with a very large genome length, displaying the lowest gene density.

2. **Variation in Gene Size**:
	- In complex eukaryotes (such as humans), genes are often larger, containing more introns and regulatory regions.
	- Conversely, genes in simple organisms (like Escherichia coli) are smaller, usually lacking introns, and with smaller intergenic regions.

3. **Definition of Gene Density**:
	- Gene density refers to the number of genes per unit length of DNA. In complex organisms, as the genome expands, the number of genes relatively decreases, leading to a decrease in gene density.

From these observations, the conclusion can be drawn that in complex eukaryotic genomes, gene density decreases while gene size increases.

In complex eukaryotic organisms like humans, genes are often larger and contain more introns and regulatory regions due to the increased complexity of gene regulation and the need for more sophisticated control mechanisms. Eukaryotic genes require a variety of regulatory elements to control their expression, including enhancers, silencers, and promoters, which contribute to the larger size of genes. Introns play a role in alternative splicing, which allows a single gene to code for multiple protein isoforms with different functions.

On the other hand, in simple prokaryotic organisms like Escherichia coli (E. coli), genes are smaller and typically do not contain introns because they have more streamlined gene expression processes. Prokaryotic genomes are compact and efficient, with genes arranged closely together without much non-coding DNA between them. This compact organization allows for rapid gene expression and adaptation to changing environmental conditions.

Overall, the differences in gene size and organization between eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms reflect their distinct evolutionary histories and the complexity of gene regulation in eukaryotes.

### Chapter 5 The Structure and Versatility of RNA

> RNA 的结构和多功能性

#### Original Text

RNA differs from DNA in the following ways: Its backbone contains ribose rather than 20-deoxyribose; it contains the pyrimidine uracil in place of thymine; and it usually exists as a single polynucleotide chain, without a complementary chain. As a consequence of being a single strand, RNA can fold back on itself to form short stretches of double helix between regions that are complementary to each other. RNA allows a greater range of base pairing than does DNA. Thus, as well as A:U and C:G pairing, non-Watson – Crick pairing is also seen, such as U pairing with G. This capacity to form noncanonical base pairs adds to the propensity of RNA to form double-helical segments. Freed of the constraint of forming long-range regular helices, RNA can form complex tertiary structures, which are often based on unconventional interactions between bases and the sugar – phosphate backbone.

Some RNAs act as enzymes—they catalyze chemical reactions in the cell and in vitro. These RNA enzymes are known as **ribozymes**. Most ribozymes act on phosphorous centers, as in the case of the ribonuclease RNase P. RNase P is composed of protein and RNA, but it is the RNA moiety that is the catalyst. The hammerhead is a self-cleaving RNA, which cuts the RNA backbone via the formation of a $2^\prime,3^\prime$ cyclic phosphate. Peptidyl transferase is an example of a ribozyme that acts on a carbon center. This ribozyme, which is responsible for the formation of the peptide bond, is one of the RNA compo- nents of the ribosome.

#### Translated Text

RNA 与 DNA 在以下几个方面有所不同：其骨架含有核糖，而不是 2-de氧核糖；它含有嘧啶尿嘧啶（uracil），而不是胸腺嘧啶（thymine）；并且通常以单链多核苷酸的形式存在，没有互补链。由于是单链，RNA 可以自我折叠，形成短的双螺旋结构，这些结构位于互补区域之间。RNA 允许比 DNA 更广泛的碱基配对。因此，除了 A:U 和 C:G 配对外，还可以观察到非 Watson-Crick 配对，例如 U 与 G 的配对。这种形成非典型碱基对的能力增加了 RNA 形成双螺旋片段的倾向。摆脱了形成长程规则螺旋的限制，RNA 可以形成复杂的三级结构，这些结构通常基于碱基与糖-磷酸骨架之间的非常规相互作用。

一些 RNA 作为酶发挥作用——它们催化细胞内和体外的化学反应。这些 RNA 酶被称为 **核酶**（ribozymes）。大多数核酶作用于磷中心，例如核糖核酸酶 RNase P。RNase P 由蛋白质和 RNA 组成，但催化剂是 RNA 部分。锤头 RNA 是一种自切割 RNA，通过形成 $2^\prime,3^\prime$ 环状磷酸盐切割 RNA 骨架。肽酰转移酶是作用于碳中心的核酶的一个例子。这种核酶负责肽键的形成，是核糖体的 RNA 组分之一。
