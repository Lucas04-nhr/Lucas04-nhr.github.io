## Week 4 Homework of Database

You can see and download the homework files <a href="https://github.com/Lucas04-nhr/Database/tree/main/Homework_and_OJ%2FWeek%204" target="_blank">here</a>.

The homework is done by using native SQL sripts, Shell scripts and Python.

### Usage

Download the directory , simply `cd` to the directory and run the executable file `init` to see the output. You may be prompted to import the test data generated randomly manually because of an unsolved bug in the Python script.

### Things to be known

1. I prepared a click-to-run SQL script to automatically import the data, but the Python interpreter fail to execute it again and again, so I removed the automatic script in the Python file.

2. To prevent some of you-know-what compatible issues and the to ensure the network stability, you should install conda or at least miniconda and change the repo source of `conda`, `apt` (on Debian Linux and Ubuntu), `yum` (on RedHat Enterprise Linux) or `HomeBrew` (on macOS) to one of the mirror inside mainland China, such as `https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn`. See official documentation about how to change repo sources.

3. The homework is tested under macOS 14.3.1 and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and the Python script is tested under Python 3.12. The SQL script is tested under MySQL 8.0.28. The shell script is tested under `bash` 5.1.8. So if you are using other versions of the software, you may need to modify the script to make it work.
