8. Why does the DNA helix twist to the right instead of the left?

	> The answer is generated by GPT-3.5-Turbo

	**Answer:** The DNA helix twists to the right due to the chirality of the deoxyribose sugar molecules in the DNA backbone. The deoxyribose sugars in DNA are in the D-configuration, which causes the helix to naturally twist in a right-handed direction. This chirality of the sugar molecules dictates the direction of the helical twist in DNA.

9. Various conformations of nucleic acids - Z fold and B fold

	> The answer is generated by GPT-4o-mini

	Z-DNA and B-DNA are two different DNA double helix structures, and their main structural differences lie in the twisting direction of the DNA and the interactions between the base pairs.

	B-DNA is the most common DNA structure, with a right-handed helix, where the base pairs are interconnected through hydrogen bonds. In contrast, Z-DNA has a left-handed helix, and the interactions between the base pairs are more complex, involving hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and stacking interactions. These different modes of interaction lead to the structural differences between Z-DNA and B-DNA.

	Additionally, Z-DNA usually forms in specific sequences or structures, such as in DNA supercoils, negative supercoiled regions, or sequences rich in GC base pairs. These specific sequences and structures are also among the reasons for the structural differences between Z-DNA and B-DNA.

10. Why is DNA the primary genetic material?

	DNA is the primary genetic material in most organisms because of its unique properties that make it well-suited for storing and transmitting genetic information. Some key reasons why DNA is the primary genetic material include:

	1. **Stability:** DNA is a stable molecule due to its double-stranded structure and the presence of hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs. This stability helps ensure the accurate transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next.

	2. **Replication:** DNA can be accurately replicated through the process of DNA replication, where each strand serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand. This allows for faithful transmission of genetic information during cell division.

	3. **Information storage:** DNA has a linear sequence of nucleotide bases (adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine) that encode the genetic information. This sequence can be transcribed into RNA and translated into proteins, allowing for the expression of genes and the functioning of cells.

	4. **Mutability:** While DNA is stable, it also allows for genetic variation through mutations, which can arise due to errors in replication, exposure to mutagens, or other factors. This genetic variability is important for evolution and adaptation to changing environments.

	Overall, DNA's stability, replicative capacity, information storage capabilities, and mutability make it a highly effective molecule for serving as the primary genetic material in living organisms.

### Chapter 1 The Mendelian View of the world

> 孟德尔的世界观

#### Original Text

Heredity is controlled by chromosomes, which are the cellular carriers of genes. Hereditary factors were first discovered and described by Mendel in 1865, but their importance was not realized until the start of the 20th century. Each gene can exist in a variety of different forms called alleles. Mendel proposed that a hereditary factor (now known to be a gene) for each hereditary trait is given by each parent to each of its offspring. The physical basis for this behavior is the distribution of homologous chromosomes during meiosis: one (randomly chosen) of each pair of homologous chromosomes is distributed to each haploid cell. When two genes are on the same chromo- some, they tend to be inherited together (linked). Genes affecting different characteristics are sometimes inherited independently of each other, because they are located on different chromosomes. In any case, linkage is seldom complete because homologous chromosomes attach to each other during meiosis and often break at identical spots and rejoin crossways (crossing over). Crossing over transfers genes initially located on a paternally derived chromosome onto gene groups originating from the maternal parent.

Different alleles from the same gene arise by inheritable changes (mutations) in the gene itself. Normally, genes are extremely stable and are copied exactly during chromosome duplication; mutation occurs only rarely and usually has harmful consequences. Mutation does, however, play a positive role, because the accumulation of rare favorable mutations provides the basis for genetic variability that is presupposed by the theory of evolution.

For many years, the structure of genes and the chemical ways in which they control cellular characteristics were a mystery. As soon as large numbers of spontaneous mut tions had been described, it became obvious that a one gene – one characteristic relationship does not exist and that all complex characteristics are under the control of many genes. The most sensible idea, postulated by Garrod in 1909, was that genes affect the synthesis of enzymes. However, the tools of Mendelian geneticists—organisms such as the corn plant, the mouse, and even the fruit fly *Drosophila*—were not suitable for detailed chemical investigations of gene – protein relations. For this type of analysis, work with much simpler organisms was to become indispensable.

遗传是由染色体控制的，染色体是基因的细胞载体。遗传因素最早由孟德尔在1865年发现和描述，但直到20世纪初才意识到它们的重要性。每个基因可以存在多种不同形式，称为等位基因。孟德尔提出，每个遗传特征的遗传因子（现在被称为基因）是由每个父母传递给每个后代的。这种行为的物理基础是减数分裂期间同源染色体的分布：每对同源染色体中的一个（随机选择）分配给每个单倍体细胞。当两个基因位于同一染色体上时，它们倾向于一起遗传（连锁）。影响不同特征的基因有时会独立遗传，因为它们位于不同的染色体上。无论如何，连锁很少是完全的，因为同源染色体在减数分裂期间相互连接，并经常在相同的位置断裂并交叉重组（交叉互换）。交叉互换将最初位于父源染色体上的基因转移到母源染色体上的基因组。

同一基因的不同等位基因是通过基因本身的可遗传变化（突变）产生的。通常，基因非常稳定，在染色体复制期间被精确复制；突变很少发生，通常会产生有害后果。然而，突变也发挥着积极作用，因为罕见有利突变的积累为进化理论所预设的遗传变异性提供了基础。

多年来，基因的结构以及它们控制细胞特征的化学方式一直是一个谜。当大量自发突变被描述后，很明显一个基因对应一个特征的关系并不存在，所有复杂特征都受到许多基因的控制。加罗德在1909年提出的最合理的想法是基因影响酶的合成。然而，孟德尔遗传学家使用的工具——如玉米植物、小鼠，甚至果蝇 *Drosophila*——并不适合用于基因-蛋白质关系的详细化学研究。对于这种类型的分析，与更简单的生物一起工作将变得不可或缺。

### Chapter 2 Nucleic Acids Convey Genetic Information

#### Original Text

The discovery that DNA is the genetic material can be traced to experiments performed by Griffith, who showed that nonvirulent strains of bacteria could be genetically transformed with a substance derived from a heat-killed pathogenic strain. Avery, McCarty, and MacLeod subsequently demonstrated that the transforming substance was DNA. Further evidence that DNA is the genetic material was obtained by Hershey and Chase in experiments with radiolabeled bacteriophage. Building on Chargaff ’s rules and Franklin and Wilkins’ X-ray diffraction studies, Watson and Crick proposed a double-helical structure of DNA. In this model, two polynucleotide chains are twisted around each other to form a regular double helix. The two chains within the double helix are held together by hydrogen bonds between pairs of bases. Adenine is always joined to thymine, and guanine is always bonded to cytosine. The existence of the base pairs means that the sequence of nucleotides along the two chains are not identical, but complementary. The finding of this relationship suggested a mechanism for the replication of DNA in which each strand serves as a template for its complement. Proof for this hypothesis came from (a) the observation of Meselson and Stahl that the two strands of each double helix separate during each round of DNA replication, and (b) Kornberg’s discovery of an enzyme that uses single-stranded DNA as a template for the synthesis of a complementary strand.

As we have seen, according to the “central dogma” information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. This transformation is achieved in two steps. First, DNA is transcribed into an RNA intermediate (messenger RNA), and second, the mRNA is translated into protein. Translation of the mRNA requires RNA adaptor molecules called tRNAs. The key char- acteristic of the genetic code is that each triplet codon is recognized by a tRNA, which is associated with a cognate amino acid. Out of 64 (4 $\times$ 4 $\times$ 4) potential codons, 61 are used to specify the 20 amino acid building blocks of proteins, whereas 3 are used to provide chain-terminating signals. Knowledge of the genetic code allows us to predict protein-coding sequences from DNA sequences. The advent of rapid DNA sequencing methods has ushered in a new era of genomics, in which complete genome sequences are being determined for a wide variety of organisms, including humans. Comparing genome sequences offers a powerful method to identify critical regions of the genome that encode not only important elements of proteins but also regulatory regions that control the expression of genes and the duplication of the genome.

DNA 被确认为遗传物质的发现可以追溯到由格里菲斯进行的实验，他展示了非致病菌株可以通过来自热杀死的致病菌株的物质进行遗传转化。埃弗里、麦卡蒂和麦克劳德随后证明了这种转化物质就是 DNA 。赫希和查斯在用放射性标记的噬菌体进行实验中获得了进一步证据，证明了 DNA 是遗传物质。在查尔格夫的规则以及富兰克林和威尔金斯的X射线衍射研究的基础上，沃森和克里克提出了 DNA 的双螺旋结构。在这个模型中，两条多核苷酸链缠绕在一起形成一个规则的双螺旋。双螺旋内的两条链通过碱基对之间的氢键相互连接。腺嘌呤总是与胸腺嘧啶结合，鸟嘌呤总是与胞嘧啶结合。碱基对的存在意味着两条链上的核苷酸序列并不相同，而是互补的。这种关系的发现暗示了 DNA 复制的机制，其中每条链都作为其互补链的模板。这一假设的证据来自于（a）梅瑟森和斯托尔观察到每轮 DNA 复制时双螺旋的两条链会分离，以及（b）科恩伯格发现了一种酶，该酶利用单链 DNA 作为合成互补链的模板。

正如我们所见，根据“中心法则”，信息从 DNA 流向 RNA  再到蛋白质。这一转化分为两步。首先，DNA被转录成RNA中间体（信使RNA），然后，mRNA 被翻译成蛋白质。mRNA 的翻译需要称为tRNA的RNA适配分子。遗传密码的关键特征是每个三联密码子被一个与之相关的氨基酸结合的tRNA所识别。在 64 个（4 $\times$ 4 $\times$ 4）潜在密码子中，有61个用于指定蛋白质的20种氨基酸构建块，而另外3个用于提供链终止信号。对遗传密码的了解使我们能够从DNA序列中预测蛋白质编码序列。快速 DNA 测序方法的出现开启了基因组学的新时代，各种生物体的完整基因组序列正在被确定，包括人类。比较基因组序列提供了一个强大的方法，用于识别基因组中不仅编码蛋白质重要元素，还控制基因表达和基因组复制的调控区域。
