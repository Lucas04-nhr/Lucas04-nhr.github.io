#### Chapter 1 The Mendelian View of the world

> 孟德尔的世界观

##### Original Text

Heredity is controlled by chromosomes, which are the cellular carriers of genes. Hereditary factors were first discovered and described by Mendel in 1865, but their importance was not realized until the start of the 20th century. Each gene can exist in a variety of different forms called alleles. Mendel proposed that a hereditary factor (now known to be a gene) for each hereditary trait is given by each parent to each of its offspring. The physical basis for this behavior is the distribution of homologous chromosomes during meiosis: one (randomly chosen) of each pair of homologous chromosomes is distributed to each haploid cell. When two genes are on the same chromo- some, they tend to be inherited together (linked). Genes affecting different characteristics are sometimes inherited independently of each other, because they are located on different chromosomes. In any case, linkage is seldom complete because homologous chromosomes attach to each other during meiosis and often break at identical spots and rejoin crossways (crossing over). Crossing over transfers genes initially located on a paternally derived chromosome onto gene groups originating from the maternal parent.

Different alleles from the same gene arise by inheritable changes (mutations) in the gene itself. Normally, genes are extremely stable and are copied exactly during chromosome duplication; mutation occurs only rarely and usually has harmful consequences. Mutation does, however, play a positive role, because the accumulation of rare favorable mutations provides the basis for genetic variability that is presupposed by the theory of evolution.

For many years, the structure of genes and the chemical ways in which they control cellular characteristics were a mystery. As soon as large numbers of spontaneous mut tions had been described, it became obvious that a one gene – one characteristic relationship does not exist and that all complex characteristics are under the control of many genes. The most sensible idea, postulated by Garrod in 1909, was that genes affect the synthesis of enzymes. However, the tools of Mendelian geneticists—organisms such as the corn plant, the mouse, and even the fruit fly *Drosophila*—were not suitable for detailed chemical investigations of gene – protein relations. For this type of analysis, work with much simpler organisms was to become indispensable.

遗传是由染色体控制的，染色体是基因的细胞载体。遗传因素最早由孟德尔在1865年发现和描述，但直到20世纪初才意识到它们的重要性。每个基因可以存在多种不同形式，称为等位基因。孟德尔提出，每个遗传特征的遗传因子（现在被称为基因）是由每个父母传递给每个后代的。这种行为的物理基础是减数分裂期间同源染色体的分布：每对同源染色体中的一个（随机选择）分配给每个单倍体细胞。当两个基因位于同一染色体上时，它们倾向于一起遗传（连锁）。影响不同特征的基因有时会独立遗传，因为它们位于不同的染色体上。无论如何，连锁很少是完全的，因为同源染色体在减数分裂期间相互连接，并经常在相同的位置断裂并交叉重组（交叉互换）。交叉互换将最初位于父源染色体上的基因转移到母源染色体上的基因组。

同一基因的不同等位基因是通过基因本身的可遗传变化（突变）产生的。通常，基因非常稳定，在染色体复制期间被精确复制；突变很少发生，通常会产生有害后果。然而，突变也发挥着积极作用，因为罕见有利突变的积累为进化理论所预设的遗传变异性提供了基础。

多年来，基因的结构以及它们控制细胞特征的化学方式一直是一个谜。当大量自发突变被描述后，很明显一个基因对应一个特征的关系并不存在，所有复杂特征都受到许多基因的控制。加罗德在1909年提出的最合理的想法是基因影响酶的合成。然而，孟德尔遗传学家使用的工具——如玉米植物、小鼠，甚至果蝇 *Drosophila*——并不适合用于基因-蛋白质关系的详细化学研究。对于这种类型的分析，与更简单的生物一起工作将变得不可或缺。

#### Chapter 2 Nucleic Acids Convey Genetic Information

##### Original Text

The discovery that DNA is the genetic material can be traced to experiments performed by Griffith, who showed that nonvirulent strains of bacteria could be genetically transformed with a substance derived from a heat-killed pathogenic strain. Avery, McCarty, and MacLeod subsequently demonstrated that the transforming substance was DNA. Further evidence that DNA is the genetic material was obtained by Hershey and Chase in experiments with radiolabeled bacteriophage. Building on Chargaff ’s rules and Franklin and Wilkins’ X-ray diffraction studies, Watson and Crick proposed a double-helical structure of DNA. In this model, two polynucleotide chains are twisted around each other to form a regular double helix. The two chains within the double helix are held together by hydrogen bonds between pairs of bases. Adenine is always joined to thymine, and guanine is always bonded to cytosine. The existence of the base pairs means that the sequence of nucleotides along the two chains are not identical, but complementary. The finding of this relationship suggested a mechanism for the replication of DNA in which each strand serves as a template for its complement. Proof for this hypothesis came from (a) the observation of Meselson and Stahl that the two strands of each double helix separate during each round of DNA replication, and (b) Kornberg’s discovery of an enzyme that uses single-stranded DNA as a template for the synthesis of a complementary strand.

As we have seen, according to the “central dogma” information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. This transformation is achieved in two steps. First, DNA is transcribed into an RNA intermediate (messenger RNA), and second, the mRNA is translated into protein. Translation of the mRNA requires RNA adaptor molecules called tRNAs. The key char- acteristic of the genetic code is that each triplet codon is recognized by a tRNA, which is associated with a cognate amino acid. Out of 64 (4 $\times$ 4 $\times$ 4) potential codons, 61 are used to specify the 20 amino acid building blocks of proteins, whereas 3 are used to provide chain-terminating signals. Knowledge of the genetic code allows us to predict protein-coding sequences from DNA sequences. The advent of rapid DNA sequencing methods has ushered in a new era of genomics, in which complete genome sequences are being determined for a wide variety of organisms, including humans. Comparing genome sequences offers a powerful method to identify critical regions of the genome that encode not only important elements of proteins but also regulatory regions that control the expression of genes and the duplication of the genome.

DNA 被确认为遗传物质的发现可以追溯到由格里菲斯进行的实验，他展示了非致病菌株可以通过来自热杀死的致病菌株的物质进行遗传转化。埃弗里、麦卡蒂和麦克劳德随后证明了这种转化物质就是 DNA 。赫希和查斯在用放射性标记的噬菌体进行实验中获得了进一步证据，证明了 DNA 是遗传物质。在查尔格夫的规则以及富兰克林和威尔金斯的X射线衍射研究的基础上，沃森和克里克提出了 DNA 的双螺旋结构。在这个模型中，两条多核苷酸链缠绕在一起形成一个规则的双螺旋。双螺旋内的两条链通过碱基对之间的氢键相互连接。腺嘌呤总是与胸腺嘧啶结合，鸟嘌呤总是与胞嘧啶结合。碱基对的存在意味着两条链上的核苷酸序列并不相同，而是互补的。这种关系的发现暗示了 DNA 复制的机制，其中每条链都作为其互补链的模板。这一假设的证据来自于（a）梅瑟森和斯托尔观察到每轮 DNA 复制时双螺旋的两条链会分离，以及（b）科恩伯格发现了一种酶，该酶利用单链 DNA 作为合成互补链的模板。

正如我们所见，根据“中心法则”，信息从 DNA 流向 RNA  再到蛋白质。这一转化分为两步。首先，DNA被转录成RNA中间体（信使RNA），然后，mRNA 被翻译成蛋白质。mRNA 的翻译需要称为tRNA的RNA适配分子。遗传密码的关键特征是每个三联密码子被一个与之相关的氨基酸结合的tRNA所识别。在 64 个（4 $\times$ 4 $\times$ 4）潜在密码子中，有61个用于指定蛋白质的20种氨基酸构建块，而另外3个用于提供链终止信号。对遗传密码的了解使我们能够从DNA序列中预测蛋白质编码序列。快速 DNA 测序方法的出现开启了基因组学的新时代，各种生物体的完整基因组序列正在被确定，包括人类。比较基因组序列提供了一个强大的方法，用于识别基因组中不仅编码蛋白质重要元素，还控制基因表达和基因组复制的调控区域。

### Questions

The first slide corresponds to Chapters 1 and 2 of the textbook.

#### Chapter 1 The Mendelian View of the world

1. You are comparing two alleles of Gene X. What defines the two alleles as distinct alleles?

	Two alleles of a gene are considered distinct alleles if they have differences in their DNA sequences. These differences can be in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, or other types of mutations that result in variations in the gene's sequence. These sequence differences can lead to variations in the protein encoded by the gene, affecting its structure or function. This variation in gene sequence is what defines the two alleles as distinct alleles of Gene X.

2. True or false. Explain your choice. One gene possesses only two alleles.

	**False.** One gene can possess more than two alleles. While classical Mendelian genetics often simplifies genetic inheritance to two alleles per gene (one from each parent), in reality, genes can have multiple alleles due to variations in the DNA sequence. These multiple alleles can arise from different mutations or polymorphisms within the gene, leading to a diverse range of genetic variations within a population. Therefore, it is possible for a gene to have more than two alleles.

3. True or false. Explain your choice. One trait is always determined by one gene.

4. True or false. Explain your choice. For a given gene, one can always define the alleles as dominant or recessive.

5. You want to identify dominant/recessive relation- ship for skin color for a new frog species that you found in the rain forest. Assume that one autosomal gene controls skin color in this species. All of the frogs that you found for that spe- cies are bright blue or yellow. A bright blue female and bright blue male frog mate and produce all bright blue progeny. A yel- low female and yellow male frog mate and produce a mix of bright blue and yellow progeny. Identify each trait (bright blue skin color and yellow skin color) as dominant or recessive. Explain your choices. Identify the genotype for each parent in the two crosses. Use the letter B to refer to the gene conferring skin color.

6. Questions:

	- After crossing true-breeding pea plants with yellow seeds to true-breeding pea plants with green seeds as Mendel did, what phenotype do you expect for the pea plants in the $F_1$ generation if yellow seeds are dominant to green seeds?

	- You self-cross the $F_1$ generation. Give the expected pheno- typic ratio of the $F_2$ generation.

	- Give the expected genotypic ratio of the $F_2$ generation.

	- Give the expected ratio of heterozygotes to homozygotes in the $F_2$ generation.

7. Mendel studied seven distinct traits for pea plants. By luck six of the traits were on different chromosomes, and two traits were separated by a great distance on one chromosome. If Mendel selected two traits controlled by linked genes in his initial studies, which law would be affected (Mendel’s first or second law)? Explain your choice.

8. You want to map the positions of three genes (*X*, *Y*, and *Z*) all found on one chromosome in Drosophila. Each gene has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. You perform the three different two-factor crosses (Cross 1: *XY* and *xy*, Cross 2: *YZ* and *yz*, and Cross 3: *XZ* and *xz*). Assume all crosses are between diploid flies homozygous for the alleles of these genes. You observe 7% recombinants in the first cross, $20\%$ recombinants in the second cross, and $13\%$ recombinants in the third cross. Draw a map placing the genes in the proper order and give the distance between each gene in map units (m.u.).

9. You want to confirm your ordering for Question 8 using a three-factor cross (cross *XYZ*/*xyz* and *xyz*/*xyz*). Your least common recombinants are *xYZ* and *Xyz*. Does this confirm your order from Question 8? Explain why or why not.

10. You again want to map the positions of three genes (*L*, *M*, and *N*) in Drosophila. Each gene has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. You perform the three different two-factor crosses (Cross 1: *LM* and *lm*, Cross 2: *MN* and *mn*, and Cross 3: *LN* and *ln*). Assume all crosses are between diploid flies homozygous for the alleles of these genes. You observe $5\%$ recombinants in the first cross, $50\%$ recombinants in the second cross, and $50\%$ recombinants in the third cross. Based on the data given, what can you determine for the gene order and distance between the genes?

11. Following up on the observations in Question 10, you complete new crosses using gene *O*. You observe $30\%$ recom- bination for a cross between *MO* and *mo*, $35\%$ recombination for a cross between *LO* and *lo*, and $25\%$ recombination for a cross between *NO* and *no*. Assume all crosses are between diploid flies homozygous for the alleles of these genes. Given the information from Questions 10 and 11, draw a map placing the genes in the proper order and give the distance between each gene in map units.

12. Define mutation. The cell has many mechanisms to prevent mutations. Explain how a very low mutation rate could be advantageous over the prevention of all mutations in an organism.

13. Differentiate between chromosomes and chromatids.

14. You are mapping the 6th chromosome of the sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina and want to test how your calculations compare to a published map. In a recent cross, you studied the mutations *tri*, pk, and *y* that display thickened vein junctions, pink body color, and yellow eyes, respectively. From a cross between a male homozygous for the three mutations and a heter- ozygous female (*tri pk y*/ $+++$​), you record the counts for the progeny. In the published map, the distance between *y* and *pk* is 23.0 m.u., the distance between *pk* and *tri* is 18.4 m.u., and the distance between *y* and *tri* is 41.4 m.u. Based on the published map and given values below, calculate the expected values for observed progeny that represent either a single or double crossover. Remember that your observed values are data that include some statistical fluctuations.

	**Total progeny counted:** 1000

	**Total recombinants that represent a double crossover**: 15

	Published map information from Weller and Foster (1993. *Genome* **36**: 495–506).

15. You are studying a new species of bird. You know the species has sex chromosomes similar to chicken. Males carry two Z chromosomes, whereas females carry one Z chromosome and one W chromosome. Because the genome has not been sequenced yet, you will perform crosses to gain more genetic information. You are interested in the eye color of the birds. You obtain true-breeding birds with black or green eyes. You cross a black-eyed male to a green-eyed female. Assume the trait is determined by one gene.

	- Considering a dominant/recessive relationship, you want to determine if black is recessive to green or if green is recessive to black. How could you use the phenotypes for the $F_1$ and $F_2$ progeny to help you answer this question?
	- If the trait is sex-linked, refine your answer to part A with respect to the dominant/recessive relationship of a sex- linked trait on the Z chromosome for the $F_1$ generation.
	- Assume that black is dominant to green. You cross a blackeyed male from the $F_1$ generation to a black-eyed female from the $F_1$ generation. If the trait is sex-linked, predict the genotypic and phenotypic ratios for the $F_2$ generation.
